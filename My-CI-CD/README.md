## ✅ Prerequisites

- A **GitHub repository** for your app.
- Basic knowledge of **GitHub Actions**.
- The app you want to automate CI/CD for (e.g., a **Python Flask app**, **Node.js app**, etc.).
- The required **deployment environment** (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Docker).

## 🧑‍💻 Project Structure

```
ci-cd-pipeline-app/
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci-cd-pipeline.yml   # GitHub Actions pipeline file
│
├── app.py   # Your app's main file (for Flask, Django, etc.)
├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies file (for Python projects)
├── Dockerfile  # If you are using Docker for deployment
└── README.md  # This file
```

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Create a GitHub Actions Workflow File

1. In your project repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.

2. Create a `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` file inside `.github/workflows/`.

Here’s an example for a **Python Flask app**:

`.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline for Python Flask App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on push to main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull requests to main branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'  # Change as per your app's Python version

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest  # Assuming you are using pytest for testing
    
    - name: Build Docker image (Optional)
      run: |
        docker build -t my-app .
    
    - name: Deploy to AWS (or any other service)
      run: |
        # Example for AWS Lambda deployment, add your own deploy script
        aws lambda update-function-code --function-name my-flask-app --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 2: Set Up Your Application

1. **Create your application**, such as a Flask app:

`app.py` (Python Flask app example):

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello, Divya! CI/CD Pipeline working fine! 🎉"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

2. **Define dependencies** in `requirements.txt`:

```
Flask==2.0.1
pytest==6.2.5
```

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Add Tests (Optional)

You can add tests to ensure your app works as expected:

`test_app.py`:

```python
import pytest
from app import app

def test_hello():
    client = app.test_client()
    response = client.get('/')
    assert response.data == b"Hello, Divya! CI/CD Pipeline working fine! 🎉"
```

---

## 🛠️ Step 4: Set Up AWS (or another deployment environment)

You can deploy your app to **AWS Lambda**, **Heroku**, **EC2**, or any service. For AWS Lambda, make sure you have the **IAM roles** set up and **AWS CLI configured**.

Example for AWS Lambda:

1. **Zip your function** (if deploying to AWS Lambda):

```bash
zip function.zip app.py
```

2. The **deploy step** in your GitHub Actions file will automatically update the Lambda function with each push to the `main` branch.

For **Docker deployment** (if you’re using Docker), you can push the Docker image to **Amazon ECR** or **DockerHub**.

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Test the Pipeline

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (commit and push to `main` or create a pull request):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Set up CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

2. **Check the Actions tab** in your GitHub repository to see the pipeline run.

---

## 🧼 Step 6: Clean Up

Once you're done, you can clean up any resources you’ve used, such as:

- Deleting old Docker images.
- Removing deployed functions from AWS Lambda.
